# CofG Calculator
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/RPd2holDHS8
#### Description: It is a web app that allows users to calculate the Center of Gravity and Actual take off mass of different DHC-6 400 and 300 series of a given fleet.
#### The code is deployed in heroku using the following link: https://cofg-calculator.herokuapp.com/
#### What is the Center of gravity? The center of gravity of an object is where we can consider all of the weight of the object to be concentrated. 
#### This is a useful concept in physics and engineering. It is used to determine the stability of objects when they are tilted.
#### In aviation in particular it is used to know the effectiveness of the control surfaces (aileron, rudder...), if it is within a certain range, the aricraft will be able to fly
#### and be controlled by the pilot; otherwise the aircraft will not be controllable leading to obvious catastrophic results. This is why all pilots must submit 
#### a documents stating the mass distribution of each flight and the calculation of the center of gravity to make sure it is within limits.
#### This project is using a flask framework of python. There is a main application.py where you can find all the logic of the web app. In the same
#### directory you can find a folder called static where all media an css is found and another folder called templates where you can find all html.
#### There is also a profile and a requirements.txt in order to be able to deploy the code in heroku
